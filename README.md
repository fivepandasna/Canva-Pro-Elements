### Project Goals
<details>
  <summary>Project Goals</summary>
    
The current main goal of this project is to allow users to easily download and use canva pro elements for free and without loss

In the future, I hope for this extension to automatically add pro elements to projects with customizable colours when right clicked in a context menu
