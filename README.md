  <summary>Usage/Instructions</summary>

Click the extension's icon in the toolbar, then select the element that you want

The element will be downloaded to a designated folder on your computer

You can add or edit then add the element to your design

Currently elements will only download in their original colours

## NOTE: The extension is very much so a WIP and currently the functions are not accurate to the title. Would not reccomend downloading it.

### Project Goals
<details>
  <summary>Project Goals</summary>
    
The current main goal of this project is to allow users to easily download and use canva pro elements for free and without loss

In the future, I hope for this extension to automatically add pro elements to projects with customizable colours when clicked
